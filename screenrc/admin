## Set up a screen session with 3 regions: 2 top and 1 bottom
##  2 top regions are populated with df/free and htop, with
##  the bottom region holding our shell


###  Set up our screens  ###

#Basic shell in window 1
screen -t shell 1 

#Root shell in window 2
screen -t root 2 sudo su -

#htop in window 3
screen -t htop 3 htop

#Show the output of df -h and free -mt, updated every 30 seconds,
# and allow wrapping of the content (just in case output is too long)
screen -t mem 4 watch -n 30 "df -h; echo ''; free -mt"
wrap          



###  Set up the regions  ###

select mem    #first select window "mem" (we want it to be top left)
split         #split the window horizontally (leaving mem on top)


focus top     #make sure the screen focus is on the top region
split -v      #now split the top region vertically (mem is top left now)
focus down    #Go to the right region
select htop   #we want htop in this region

focus down    #go to the bottom region
select shell  #we want the shell in the bottom
