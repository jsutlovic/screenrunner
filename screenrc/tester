##.screenrc tester

## Set up a screen session with 3 windows,
##  and two regions. The right region is a manpage,
##  which will close once quit
##  Also, show how parameter substitution works

###  Windows ###

#Open a new window with title "test" and window number 1,
# with these commands:
screen -t test 1 bashrnr "echo $1 $2 $3" "echo $@"

#Open another window with
# a shell in window 2, with these commands:
screen -t test2 2 bashrnr "ls ~"

#Close the region once we're done with the window
screen -t test3 3 bash -c "man screen && scrcmd remove"


###  Region setup  ###

select 1        #Select screen 1 by default 
split -v        #Split the window vertically

focus down      #Select the right region
select test3    #We want test3 in this region

focus up        #Go back to the left region (test)
